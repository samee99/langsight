# LLMOps: Exploring the Impact of Prompt Changes on LLM Responses

This repository is an initial attempt at exploring the field of LLMOps, analogous to MLOps for machine learning models. The goal is to develop a systematic approach for understanding, monitoring, and improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) by analyzing the relationship between changes in prompts and the resulting responses.

## Motivation

Large language models like GPT-3 have demonstrated remarkable abilities to understand and generate human-like text. However, the quality of the generated text can be sensitive to the choice of prompt. Small changes in the prompt can lead to significant differences in the generated response. By understanding this relationship, we can develop better practices for working with LLMs, similar to the principles of MLOps in the machine learning domain.

This repository aims to provide a foundation for LLMOps by offering a systematic way to explore and understand the relationship between changes in prompts and the resulting LLM responses.

# Exploring Prompt-Response Relationship in Large Language Models

This repository aims to explore how changes in prompts affect the responses generated by large language models (LLMs). We provide code examples and resources to help users understand the correlation between prompt variations and model output.

As a first commit to the area of LLMOps, which focuses on improving the deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and overall performance of LLMs, this repository serves as a starting point for further development and collaboration.

## Contents

1. Python scripts to analyze and visualize the relationship between prompt variations and LLM responses.
2. Code examples for generating and comparing embeddings of prompts and responses.


## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

2. Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set your OpenAI API key:

openai_api_key = "your_openai_api_key_here"

Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Running the Code

To run the code, simply execute the llm_analysis.py script:

python llm_analysis.py

The script will output similarity matrices for the given prompts and responses, and display visualizations of the correlation between them.
